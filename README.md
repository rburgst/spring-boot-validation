# Spring Boot validation

This project shows how to use
Spring Boot with Spring Data Rest, 
Spring validation integrated with
a React/Svelte frontend to get 
a proper end to end validation.

This means that also server side validation
errors are properly shown within the client
form.

## Getting started

1. run the spring boot app via `./gradlew bootRun`
2. build/run the react dev server via 
    ```
    cd client-react
    pnpm install
    pnpm dev
    ```
3. Open the browser at http://localhost:5173
